# 21_days_to_data
This challenge was introducing google colab and how to clean up data using pandas.
This challenge helped me learn how to split CMPLNT_TO_DT column into date and time which is divided by the letter 'T'
One this was done, I then used the date to convert to months of when the crimes happened and then which day of the week it happened as well
